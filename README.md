# PA Cannabis Guide
The Guide is designed to meet modern web standards, be lightweight, and be easily accessible. Anyone can suggest improvements or [contribute to its success through Github](https://github.com/OfLiberty/pacannabis.guide).

## Philosophy

The Guide is built upon three philosophies:

- Open source
- Science based medicine
- Individual liberty

### Open Source

The Guide is built using open source tools and services, primarily Vue and VuePress. The tools we create for the site will be made available for others to use. 

### Science Based Medicine

The Guide will take a [science based](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/about-science-based-medicine/) approach to what we promote. The cannabis indusry has been tied, implicitly or explicitly, to pseudoscientific beliefs and practices. It's the duty of contributors to rectify this misconception.

The U.S.'s federal prohabition of cannabis has prevented much research into cannabis. There has been organized efforts in misinforming the public and this project is seeking to rectify this deficiency.

### Individual Liberty

The Guide's ultimate purpose is to liberate the public from the bonds of ignorance. Pennsylvania's government has done a poor job of protecting our rights. This Guide seeks to correct it through education.
