## Mission Statement
Keystone Canna Remedies (KCR) believes in a care model which allows patients to take an active role in their own health maintenance. We equip physicians, caregivers and medical professionals with the extra knowledge and support structures necessary to insure that patients realize a better quality of life. In achieving this, KCR is led by a diverse group of professionals whose experiences range from medicine and pharmacology, to management and bioethics. We have also established ongoing relationships with medical marijuana experts, who guarantee us access to the latest professional data, research, and field advancements. On both a personal and professional level, our founding partners have witnessed how medical marijuana can ease suffering across a broad spectrum of afflictions. Now, all of us at KCR look forward to sharing this awareness with our patients, caregivers, and their loved ones.
