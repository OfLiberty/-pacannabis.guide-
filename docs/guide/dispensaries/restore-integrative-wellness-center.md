## Mission Statement
Restore Integrative Wellness Center is Pennsylvaniaâ€™s premier medical marijuana dispensary. We provide state-eligible patients with responsible, compassionate care using marijuana-based medicine.

We act not only as a marijuana dispensary but as a place of healing to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Our dispensary is a clean and relaxing environment, designed so you can be comfortable while receiving the care and education that you need.

From the moment you walk in, you will feel welcome and cared for by our staff who are some of the most experienced and highly-trained in the country. They will be able to answer any questions that you may have and help you through the process from start to finish.

We have two locations in the Philadelphia area. The first location is in Fishtown, across from The Fillmore. Our Fishtown location is open to patients. The second location is in Elkins Park just a short drive from 309 and easily accessible for patients in the suburbs.

We are here to assist you by any means possible and aid you in restoring your quality of life and overall sense of well-being. Visit us to take your first step toward treatment and a happier life!
