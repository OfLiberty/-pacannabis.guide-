## Mission Statement
Our vision is to deliver a clinical approach for the utilization of medical marijuana that is patient focused, collaborative, and outcomes based. We will provide safer, more effective therapies for patients who have longstanding serious medical conditions and who have failed to find adequate relief.

The mission of our caring, patient-focused team of healthcare professionals will be to deliver a unique health care experience focused on our patients and their symptom relief. Patients, caregivers, and recommending physicians will be actively involved in patient care.

We are dedicated to unlocking the therapeutic benefits of marijuana through research. We exist to improve the health and wellness of our patients.
