## Mission Statement
We put our first roots down four years ago in Washington, DC, and we've been growing ever since. Opening our first Liberty Dispensary stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts means bringing our mission to life. We're more dedicated than ever to providing individualized care, innovative products and exceptional experiences to our patients and partners. We welcome you to explore this site for more information, but the best way to get to know us is to visit one of our locations and see for yourself. We encourage patients possessing a Pennsylvania medical marijuana ID card to come into one of our locations today and see how we’re “liberating the experience."
