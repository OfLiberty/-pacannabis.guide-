# Downloading a Progressive Web App to Your Mobile (iOS) Device

*Edit: As per [this iOS issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51351500/issues-with-pwa-in-standalone-mode-on-ios-11-4) and [this build tool issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/issues/1583), PWAs are bugged in iOS when referencing the scripts our build tools use. The [PA Cannabis Guide](https://pacannabis.guide/) will not maintain support for iOS until Apple resolves the issue.*

1. Tap on the *Share* button at the bottom of the screen.
